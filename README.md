### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Website](https://bamiesking.uk) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bamiesking) / [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bamiesking)

I'm Ben (he/him), and I'm a PhD student at the University of York, within the York Centre for Quantum Technologies, working on phase control in QKD systems. 

I also like to pretend to be a programmer, with particular interests in web services built with Flask backends.
