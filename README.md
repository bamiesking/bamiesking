I'm Ben (he/him), and I'm a physics student currently finishing my MPhys in Theoretical Physics at Durham University. In October 2021, I'll start a PhD at the University of York, within the York Centre for Quantum Technologies, working on a project titled 'Experimental quantum communications at any scale'.

I also like to pretend to be a programmer, with particular interests in services built with Flask backends.
